<h1>Trader dashboard</h1>
<p>Working closely with product owners I designed a dashboard for traders using the Citi velocity platform.</p>
<p>I started with a wireframe to map out the main areas of content and some functionality to use the chart to filter the table below it.</p>

<p>Then added UI polish in the existing style of the rest of the product.</p>

<p>The feedback from traders was interesting. Having done no research or discovery was a mistake and the feedback from the traders unsurprisingly bad. They described it as 'useless' and looks like a 'vanity piece' and in fact they had even become jaded by doughnut charts, as whenever they saw one they felt the screen would have little useful substance.</p>
<p>I didn't want to be caught out by this mistake again so I started a research project to understand the users properly.</p>
